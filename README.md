arxml.vim
=========
Provides a more usefull folding for AUTOSAR XML files (arxml).
It shows the shortname of the collapsed element in the foldtext, and shows the subpackages of ar-packages elements.

TODO
========
- It would be most usefull if somehow a linking of the shortnames to the specific elements can be performed using xpath.. maybe the xpath plugin is helpfull here
- more special handlings of some elements
